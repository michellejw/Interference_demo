# Interference demo

This repository contains a python script called "interference_demo.py". It generates either a static image or a movie (in mp4 format) that demonstrates the interference pattern that would result based on a set of user-defined parameters. Within the script itself you can define parameters like frequency, number of transmitting elements, element spacing, sound speed, and the extents of the viewing window.
